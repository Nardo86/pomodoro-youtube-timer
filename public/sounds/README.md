# Bell Sound File

This directory should contain a bell sound file named `bell.mp3`.

For now, the app will use a generated beep sound as a placeholder.
To add a proper bell sound, replace the placeholder in App.js with a real audio file.

Recommended bell sound characteristics:
- Duration: 1-2 seconds
- Format: MP3 or WAV
- Clear, pleasant bell tone
- Not too loud or startling
